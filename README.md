# spark-minihack_WhoIsMyCandidate

## We were inspired by the customer service chatbots embedded within shopping sites like Amazon that could answer specific questions customers have and guide them to the right location in an app or website. 

## What it does: Our project uses a ChatGPT AI and we trained it using information from both presidential candidates’ respective campaign sites to allow the user on the front-end to ask our chatbot questions regarding either of their policies to compare and contrast. This allows the user to create a more informed decision when selecting their candidate. 


## How we built it: We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, node.JS, ChatGPT API to develop our project. 

## One challenge we ran into was converting the candidates’ policy information into usable JSON files on which to train our chatbot. We encountered numerous problems when converting this information automatically, so we converted the information into JSON files manually. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of getting our idea up and running. 
We’re proud of creating a working prototype of our project that has the potential, if improved upon, to improve voter turnout, promote civic engagement, and further participation with the government processes to keep the democratic tradition within the US alive.



## We learned one method to use an existing API, such as ChatGPT’s, and train it with our own data so that it can answer user-generated questions about our topic we trained it on. 

## WhoIsMyCandidate can be expanded upon to give information about local elections to further promote civic engagement with the democratic processes and civic responsibilities. The output response can also be optimized at a higher level, providing better responses.
